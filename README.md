# TriviaGame

This is a quiz where each question is timed. There are 10 questions.

The learnings from this project where how to use event timers to control 
	when things are happening on the users screen, how to use and access and array of objects. Storing the question, answer choices and correct answer as an object allowed a straight forward comparison of the button click to the correct answer based on the first letter of the button.
